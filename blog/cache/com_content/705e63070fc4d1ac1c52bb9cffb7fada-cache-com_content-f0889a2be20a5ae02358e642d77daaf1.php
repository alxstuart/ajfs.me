	<p><br />This christmas, I finally crossed to the dark side and bought a Macbook. It was a decision I did not take lightly; I had spent years accumulating software for the Windows ecosystem and spent many of my teen years being ferociously anti-Apple.  Despite my best efforts to stay with Microsoft, there was simply no justification to not buy the Retina Display Macbook Pro though. Especially after including the generous student discount, it offered the one of the best screens, the longest battery life, a handful of free pieces of software I might actually have use for, a beautiful design and a slightly more powerful processor, all for a few hundred pounds less than the similar counterparts from Sony, Samsung or Dell. Of course there was one other big sell; Apple is the photographer’s laptop manufacturer. </p>

Arranged by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, they sit alongside the Emmy, Tony and Academy (Oscar) Awards as the signature of a quality piece of media not only in the hosting USA, but across the entire World. There is then, without a doubt, a high pedigree amongst the performers who were celebrated at this year’s awards. So why has so much negative feedback been received?</span></p>
