		<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.1500000000000001; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Grammys - or Gramophone Awards - are perhaps the highest accolade in the world of Popular Music. Arranged by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, they sit alongside the Emmy, Tony and Academy (Oscar) Awards as the signature of a quality piece of media not only in the hosting USA, but across the entire World. There is then, without a doubt, a high pedigree amongst the performers who were celebrated at this year’s awards. So why has so much negative feedback been received?</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.1500000000000001; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Grammys hold a <a href="http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/grammy-awards-voting-proce" target="_blank">complex nomination process</a>. Firstly, a record company or individual performer/group is able to submit recordings online to be considered for nomination. Each piece is then reviewed by the panel, a collection of over 150 experts from NARAS who determine the eligibility and correct classification of the work. A piece that is cleared is then circulated on a list to all NASRAS members, who can nominate tracks in the main categories (Record, Album, and Song of the Year, and best New Artist) and their areas of expertise; Rock, Rap, Latin, Classical, etc. After the nominees are chosen, the process is repeated in a secret independent ballot system. Obviously, the highest voted nominee in each category is the winner, with ties possible. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The votes </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">should</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> be entirely uninfluenced; based only on the quality of the piece and not subjective to sales, personal loyalties or otherwise. The set of rules guiding this are laid out in the Grammy <a href="http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/grammy-awards-voting-proce" target="_blank">vote solicitation guidelines</a>, and initially we trust the integrity of the panel. “</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">8.Voters shall not accept money or anything of value in exchange for votes”</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> is a rule I’m sure all those you follow the awards would expect no less than, lest the resulting prize be handed out to the performer with the most powerful record company behind them, rather than the most skilled artist. “</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">7.

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The members may try their best, but the psyche is a fickle beast to control. Even when declaring oneself free of bias, feelings are still often held deep down. For the sake of integrity, the list of members is not disclosed, but it is not hard to predict that there is often an “Old Boys” mentality within the group. These “experts of the Industry” may well know a good tune when they hear one, but when a record disagrees with the status quo or signals a new direction it can be met with a brick wall. An example? 2013, when the iconic and occasionally infamous </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy” </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">from Kanye West avoided being nominated for album of the year  and was instead cast aside in to genre categories, despite massive commercial success and more or less sitting in its own field as an album, it did not take long for the media to retaliate. “I have never been able to discern a consistent logic around who gets nominated or who gets statues” harked <a href="http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/grammy-awards-voting-proce">Touré in the Times</a>, struggling to figure out how an artist can be nominated for 7 different awards yet not be put forward for the most esteemed prize. It is common that only “pop” rap songs make it anywhere near the nominations, and the more mature and deep content is rejected by the panel.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">A year before, Adele walks out of the Staples Center in Downtown Los Angles with 4 shining awards. A well-deserved win, given that </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">“21” </span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">had sold upwards of 20million copies worldwide and still stands as the 4</span><span style="font-size: 9px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: super; white-space: pre-wrap;">th</span><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> bestselling album ever in the UK. But follow the history of the awards she has won, and a worrying trend appears. Repeatedly, the album of the year and record of the year flip-flop between the empowered female singer-songwriter, and the indie but ‘agreeable’ rock band on the scene that year. The same structure has ticked over for a decade or more now, locked in to an act that seems far too close to the financial records that the board promise to ignore, often in disrespect of  nominees that stand above in quality. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The reason for this may exist far outside of the realms of 150 experts. In our 5000 songs in your pocket, 9.99 a month unlimited music streaming of a 20 million song catalogue, “just find it on youtube” generation, music is becoming a near infinite resource. Two decades ago, your portals to music were at the record store, in a genre specific magazine or on the radio. You may have a local pub, bar or club that acted as a venue for the emerging bands to break through in, but your entrance to each track was limited. The wise (or not so) radio disk jockeys and record store sales persons had to find the music for you, present it. Back then, a Grammy award was the golden seal of approval, highlighting the quality of the material.  But times are different now. When the new world of consumer audio mixing software like Ableton, Traktor and VirtualDJ met the internet explosion in the early 2000s, full music production suddenly reached the domain of the average person. Buy a Macbook, download the iLife software package and suddenly you’ve been given Garageband, and the music produced in your bedroom can sound like it’s been produced in a studio. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So the EDM scene erupts. Always one of the forgotten children of music, “just noise”, it is allowed to expand in the shadows. But then Youtube is founded in 2005. This is new media at its finest. It is quickly adopted as a prime location for music videos, and soon MTV is falling at the wayside as people vote with their clicks on the internet instead of being at the whim of a producer. When a hit artist releases a new song, it is only a matter of days before it’s been covered by an acepella group, jammed by an acoustic guitarist, dubstep remixed by a bedroom DJ, and been pulled through a hundred other genres, all re-uploaded to by enjoyed by the international residents of the internet. Even when we stick with the original recording by a platinum album artist, utilities within products like Google Play and Spotify can push our listening habits through a handful of algorithms to find a band they’re certain we’ll enjoy with accuracy matching that of the record store owner of yore.  As memory becomes cheap and streaming becomes common place, the breadth of the average person’s selection has come to match that of even the most powerful radio station.

<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-1d0fef11-d53d-45b1-7cf4-67ffa035572c"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Calibri; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Perhaps the members of NARAS still have responsibility: to police the domains of physical media and public broadcast air time. Their choices still reflect reality, as seen by giving Daft Punk a well-deserved trio of awards this year, but during the reign of free-media their golden statuettes given to the safest choice seem to shine a little less brightly in the artists’ cabinets. In the age of the iPod, the gramophone award is outdated.</span></span></p>	</div>
