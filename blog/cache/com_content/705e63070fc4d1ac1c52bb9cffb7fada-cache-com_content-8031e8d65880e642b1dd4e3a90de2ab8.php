		<p><br />This christmas, I finally crossed to the dark side and bought a Macbook. It was a decision I did not take lightly; I had spent years accumulating software for the Windows ecosystem and spent many of my teen years being ferociously anti-Apple.  Despite my best efforts to stay with Microsoft, there was simply no justification to not buy the Retina Display Macbook Pro though. Especially after including the generous student discount, it offered the one of the best screens, the longest battery life, a handful of free pieces of software I might actually have use for, a beautiful design and a slightly more powerful processor, all for a few hundred pounds less than the similar counterparts from Sony, Samsung or Dell. Of course there was one other big sell; Apple is the photographer’s laptop manufacturer. </p>
 
<p>It’s a long history that has created this brand association. Software packages like Aperture have allowed those buying an Apple device to have full control of RAW photo files in a way that was at points unrivalled by what was available on the other Operating Systems. The inclusion of decent graphics cards in most of the 15" models has allowed easy work with the ever popular Adobe Design suite.  </p>
<p>So why this article?</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>The Air Isn't that Tiny</h1>
<p>Firstly, lets shoot this one straight out of the sky. The Air is a perfectly fine laptop, but does not deserve to be heralded as the best device for the travelling photographer. 12-14 hours of battery would be impressive, but this is taken on my Pro after working for forty something minutes, and that is only meant to sit somewhere around 10 hours. We live in an ever connected world, and it is unlikely that you’ll ever find yourself in a position where you need a laptop for 10 continuous hours and not be near a power point for any of it. If you can afford to be travelling into the outback with a £4000 L-lens and some apple tech, you can afford to buy a solar adaptor to power the laptop.</p>
<p><img title="rMBP 13 hour battery life Screenshot" src="images/Screenshot.png" alt="rMBP battery life screenshot" align="left" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>On top of that, it’s a pretty average laptop alongside the competition. The Samsung has a better screen, the Sony Pro looks more attractive, NEC goes thinner, and footprint wise the 13”rMBP actually manages to be smaller than the 13” Air due to screen ratios. Get any of them to boot up Lightroom and work through a 400 picture shoot, and you’d struggle to discern any major difference. </p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Not so Secure Digital</h1>
<p>It amazes me that fanboys will still celebrate the inclusion of an SD card slot on any device, let alone a laptop. The sad rejection of MicroSD cards from smartphones is a result of patents, but for any tablet device or higher I would expect nothing less than an SD card lot capable of dealing with the fastest cards available at the time of device creation. It’s a quick, cheap, easy way of working with data. My bug bear with the Macs is that the damn thing doesn't go flush with the body. If you kit out your entire range with flash memory people are going to be wanting to boot up and work. This means that sometimes, I'll start working, then quickly chuck the laptop in to a bag and need to rush off somewhere. With half of a fragile SD card hanging out the laptop though, there’s a risk of damaging in transit if it wasn't removed first. Why can all their competitors manage to let the card go flush when they historically aren’t engineered half as well?</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>FireLiar</h1>
<p>Firewire is apparently the leading edge of data transfer, a blazingly fast method of getting data between devices. Apple even took the risk of including on past lines of MBPs <em>before</em> installing USB 3. But in the same way that we still have millions of petrol cars on the road and very few Hydrogen engines, despite Firewire quite possibly being the future its adoption has been slow and expensive which completely alienates it from the majority of users. A 3TB NAS drive may be available, but for those of us not creating videos on a Mac Pro desktop the advantage over USB3 is minimal at best. With USB3 alone exceeding the access speed of the hard drive, the extra 30 seconds gained if one tried to move their entire photo collection is negated by the £100 that have been saved.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Laid out in front of you</h1>
<p>The other problems are, in all honesty, objective and personal. Firstly, as a long time Windows user in English-UK, German and Spanish, the <em>slightly</em> different keyboard layout is at times more irritating than if I had just had to swap to DVORAK.  It seems second nature to me that there should be a button saying ‘prt sc’ in the top right and that the speech key should be a shift function of 2 on the number bar. But instead I have to press cmd-shift-3 to print screen (or 4, if I want a crop, because despite have an out of the way key combination OSX actually manages to have a more useful print screen function built in than windows), and the double inverted comma has migrated somewhere to the right of the keyboard. </p>
<p>If the SD card isn’t going to be flush, it shouldn’t be in front of the right side USB port. It’s quite a predictable situation that a photographer would be running Photoshop, editing a photo off of their SD card and using their Wacom tablet or mouse to give them more accuracy while they post process. They may even have a screen attached via the HDMI port, so why let the USB mouse have to cross over the AV cable and bump in to the SD card. There’s perhaps some logic in regards to reducing the amount of cable hanging around, but with such closely confined I/O ports to me it screams inconvenience.</p>
<p>And even sillier but so painfully missed is snapped windows. No longer can I open a couple of windows, press windows+left for one and windows+right for the other to have them split across the screen. A silly little thing that is largely dismissed by the 4 finger stroke on the Macbook trackpad, but still a problem that ruins my work flow.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>But….</h1>
<p>This isn’t a piece to slate the Macbook product line. They are impressive pieces of engineering, and certainly one I don’t regret buying. iPhoto is a massively under appreciated piece of library software, the trackpad on the Pro line truly sits in a different league to just about any Windows device available, and while the screen is currently being outdone by that on the Dell Precision M4800 it still stands as a beautiful portal to ones creative work in both its crispness and colour rendition. </p>
<p>What needs to stop is the fanboyism. It doesn’t matter if <a href="http://www.chasejarvis.com/">Chase Jarvis </a>or your famous photographer of choice uses it, what you need is the device that best suits your needs. Those who claim that they <em>need</em> a Macbook because they take a hundred jpeg photos a month to put on facebook are caught in a false reality where the tool defines the quality of the creator. Go out and search the market, find the specification list that suits you; screen, battery, internal storage, processor and RAM. A photographer <em>does</em> need an SSD, that I can be certain of, and they do need 8GB of RAM if they use photoshop, but the rest is up to you. Don't dispel the Macbook, it may well be the cheapest option for you as it was for me, but remember that no device is ever the <strong>only</strong> option out there.</p>	</div>
